## The following functions calculate the inverse of a matrix and saves it
## to the cache such that the next time the user attempts to calculate the
## matrix inverse, the previously saved value is returned instead of
## repeating the calculation.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object, which is really a list 
## containing a function to
## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the value of the inverse
## 4. get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
